<h1>Here is a little guide on how to run this app</h1>

To begin, it's advised that you create a virtual environment:
```
python -m venv .venv
```

Then, you can install the requirements for this project:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once that's out of the way, you should be able to launch the localhost server:
```
python manage.py runserver
```

Hope this helps ðŸ™ƒ
